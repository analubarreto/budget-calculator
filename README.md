## Budget Calculator

This is an app made with (Svelte Tutorial and Projects Course)[https://www.udemy.com/course/svelte-tutorial-and-projects-course/] by John Smilga.

Why am I doing another Svelte Course? To get the itty details about the framework I seem to have missed in the first course without having too much trouble.

Ps:. I didn't make the design, so it's not pretty (not by my standards at least), but it works quite nicely.

### What I learned with this project:

- How to use local storage
- When not to use local storage, from this (link)[https://snyk.io/blog/is-localstorage-safe-to-use/?fbclid=IwAR150WFR4CeUzxOzW51sKXs813670rpwPG2pCjxvtRCxemC-8IHhjmRIFNY]
- How properly use Svelte's lifecycle methods
- How to use ES6 patterns such as spread operators
- The true difference between map, filter and reduce
